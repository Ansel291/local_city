#Local City

---

### The Product:

Local City is an app that helps you make recommendations to your friends of locations or points of interest to visit when they are visiting from out of town. 

PLEASE NOTE that this project is very much in it's ALPHA stage of creation with many features and a lot of work still remaining to be completed.  

Currently, the App only allows a user to sign in and perform searches in any city with Google Maps and displays locations with location markers. However, the project is still currently being built with the goal that a user can Add venues from a search so that their locations will be saved onto a user page and with a map that displays that user's added locations.

### The Purpose:


When your family or loved ones come to visit your town/city and they need recommendations on a place to visit, they will be able to look up the  recommendations that you made on Local City. 

This app however makes recommendations that are unique to locals only, and strives not to promote overly "touristy" locations.  The purpose of this app is to make the visitor feel more like a "local".

###Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles:

Local City is essentially my first solo venture to create a fully functional MEAN Stack App.  The challenges for this project were incredibly significant.

Although app is successful in showcasing the aesthetic and sense of design that I like when creating Apps, this project was challenging because in my General Assembly Group Project "RESTFUL CRAWL", my only major contribution to the project was mainly CSS, Bootstrap, with very minimal computer programming on the Front End.  This is why I felt like I had to truly challenge myself by attempting to build a MEAN STACK application on my own. 

My biggest hurdle remains for me to continue to learn the nuances of the angular.js language and applying it so that I can continue to build more features for Local City.

This is a project that I will continue to work on while I am outside of General Assembly for my own personal growth as a developer.
